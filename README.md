### Game Rooms

- A player can generate a unique **invitation link**, to invite a **friend** to play with him/her by pushing the Invite Friend button. A **private room** will be created, and the player who generated this room will be the first player joining it. When the **invited player** opens the invitation link, he/she will be asked to **choose** a **name** for joining the room. When two players play in a private room, they can alwayse access the invitation link pointing to that room for **continuing** the **game** where they left.
